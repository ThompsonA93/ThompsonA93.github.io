      "Although it is a challenging topic, the lecture notes in addition with the course assignments guide through the topic.",
      "Nice course. The only issue for me was the fact that we build on top of already created MicroJava compiler rather than creating something new.",
      "The Lecturer is very good, he is quite clear, very helpful and answers all the questions. Drawback: The book (in English) was given very late in the semester; main source was slides (not always clear) and Internet.",
      "Cool course and cool teacher.",
      "I have a rather positive assessment of the course as it covered an in-depth understanding of the topic (compilers) compared to other courses at AAU. A lot of hands-on and practical assignments were also nice. Drawback: Reference book was in German, and English translation only came out in June (less than a month before the exam) for an English program course.",
      "The Lecturer did a great job creating and maintaining a positive atmosphere.",
      "Topic was good.",
      "Interactive lecture. The Lecturer paid attention to our progress and engaged to explain every question.",
      "The Lecturer is very nice and explains things in detail.",
      "Although course is built on MicroJava (rather abstract), it helps to understand the real Java bytecode better and provides enough training to obtain skills to build own compiler or compiler-like task.",
      "Practical assignments every week that helped understand concepts; group work and presentation of assignments was good."
